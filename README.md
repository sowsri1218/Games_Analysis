## **Analysis & Results**

## **Data Preprocessing**

Utilized Python libraries to ensure data integrity and prepare the dataset for analysis:

**Null Values**

Identified and dropped null values using Pandas and NumPy.

**Duplicates**

Checked for duplicates in the dataset and confirmed that no duplicates were found.

**Outliers**

Utilized SciPy to identify and handle outliers, ensuring consistency and reliability in the data.

Visualized the outliers using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better understanding and analysis.

## **Data Manipulation**

**Sales Trends**

The number of games released and sales began to increase around 1997.

Sales peaked around 2001 and saw the highest releases between 2009 and 2010.

A gradual decline in sales began from 2012 and followed by further decline in 2016.
